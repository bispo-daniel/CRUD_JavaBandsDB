# CRUD on MySQL database with Java
    Application connected to a MySQL database that contains two tables, band and album.
    
    With the Swing interface implemented in this application, 
    the user can manipulate these two tables with the following functions: 
        Create, list (read), update and delete;

    Note: To insert an album in the database, a band id must be referred. 
    That implies in the creation of a band before an album.

    At the main menu, the user can choose which function he wants to execute.
